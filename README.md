# Coffee_Shop_Sales-Project
First of all we have to create a database then import the dataset in the database for data cleaning and analysis
//CREATE DATABASE coffee_shop_sales;/

After creating the database and importing the dataset in the database, I now show a preview of the dataset in Mysql. 
//SELECT * FROM coffee_sales;/
